# More Mob Variants

Minecraft Fabric mod for adding new variants to existing mobs. Developed for 1.19.4.

For the Forge version, visit [this page](https://github.com/nyuppo/MobVariantsForge).

## Installation

This mod features **persistent variant skins for all players**, as opposed to client-side reskins that can differ from person to person.
